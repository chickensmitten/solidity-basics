## Intro to Solidity
- Solidity programming language
  - strongly types
  - relatively similar to Javascript
  - written in `.sol` files
  - Contract definition is what we write, then we deploy to a solidity compiler will create an ABI and bytecode

  - Javascript code interacts with ABI, which then translates and interacts with bytecode

- `contract` folder is where the `.sol` contract code is written
- `scripts` folder is where the deploy code is written
